# Welcome to Machine Learning Fundamentals ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet where I break down complex machine learning concepts into digestible, engaging explanations. No PhD required - just curiosity and a willingness to learn!

## What You'll Find Here

I believe that the best way to truly understand machine learning is to build intuition from the ground up. That's why I focus on explaining the fundamental algorithms that power everything from your Netflix recommendations to cutting-edge AI systems.

### ðŸ“ˆ [Gradient Descent: The Art of Rolling Downhill]({% post_url 2025-06-01-gradient-descent %})
*June 1, 2025*

Ever wondered how machines actually "learn"? It all starts with gradient descent - the workhorse optimization algorithm that powers modern AI. In this comprehensive guide, I'll take you from the intuitive "blindfolded on a mountain" analogy all the way through to advanced optimizers like Adam. 

**What you'll learn:**
- The mathematical foundations explained simply
- Three flavors of gradient descent (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-batch)
- Common pitfalls and research-backed solutions
- Why sometimes you need to go up instead of down!

*June 5, 2025*

Regression is where many people's machine learning journey begins - and for good reason! It's intuitive, powerful, and forms the foundation for understanding more complex models. This guide takes you from simple linear regression all the way through regularization techniques.

**What you'll learn:**
- Complete implementations from scratch
- When to use Ridge vs Lasso regularization
- The five critical assumptions (and why they matter)
- Real-world tips for better models

## Coming Soon ðŸŽ¯

I'm constantly working on new content to help demystify machine learning. Here's what's in the pipeline:

- **Classification Algorithms**: From logistic regression to decision trees
- **Neural Networks**: Building your first neural network from scratch
- **Clustering**: Finding patterns when you don't have labels
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Making sense of high-dimensional data

## About This Blog

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate student at NYU Tandon, and I've been on both sides of the learning curve - from struggling to understand these concepts to teaching them to others. My goal is to create the resource I wish I had when I was starting out.

Each post is crafted to:
- Build intuition before diving into math
- Include working code you can actually run
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Keep things engaging without dumbing them down
